Assignment 5

Challenge 1 
- Make a sketch of 5 bubbles using a class. Pass parameters for x and y positions, as well as radius. Optional: add styling to the bubbles (eg, change the colors, shadows, or framerate), randomize their sizes, or make them interactive.
For this challenge I made 5 bubbles that have a random starting position (both x and y), radius, and color using:
```
bubble1 = new Bubble(random(width), random(height), random(10, 40), floor(random(360)));
```
Color is HSLA formatted, so the bubbles are at 0.1 alpha, making them mostly transparent. I also added a slight shadow to the bubble to make them stand out a bit more.
